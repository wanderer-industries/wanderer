### Can Wanderer be self-hosted?

Wanderer is open source project and we have a free as in beer and self-hosted solution called [Wanderer Community Edition (CE)](https://wanderer.ltd/news/community-edition). Here are the differences between Wanderer and Wanderer CE:

|                               | Wanderer Cloud                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Wanderer Community Edition                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |

| **Infrastructure management** | Easy and convenient. It takes 2 minutes to register your character and create a map. We manage everything so you donâ€™t have to worry about anything and can focus on gameplay.                                                                                                                                                              | You do it all yourself.
