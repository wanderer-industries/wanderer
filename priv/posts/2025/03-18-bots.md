# Get Real-Time Notifications with Wanderer Notifier

[Wanderer Notifier](https://guarzo.github.io/wanderer-notifier/) delivers real-time alerts directly to your Discord channel, ensuring you never miss critical in-game events. Whether it's a significant kill, a newly tracked character, or a fresh system discovery, our notifier keeps you informed with rich, detailed notifications.

In the fast-paced universe of EVE Online, timely information can mean the difference between success and failure. When a hostile fleet enters your territory, when a high-value target appears in your hunting grounds, or when a new wormhole connection opens up valuable opportunities - knowing immediately gives you the edge. Wanderer Notifier bridges this information gap, bringing critical intel directly to your Discord where your team is already coordinating.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up Wanderer Notifier, ensure you have the following:

- A Discord server where you have administrator permissions
- Docker and Docker Compose installed on your system
- Basic knowledge of terminal/command line operations
- Your Wanderer map URL and API token
- A Discord bot token (see our [guide on creating a Discord bot](https://gist.github.com/guarzo/a4d238b932b6a168ad1c5f0375c4a561))

## How to Get Started

There are two ways to install Wanderer Notifier: a **Quick Install** option using a one-liner, or a **Manual Setup** for those who prefer step-by-step control.

### Quick Install Option

For a streamlined installation that creates the necessary directory and files automatically, run:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://gist.githubusercontent.com/guarzo/3f05f3c57005c3cf3585869212caecfe/raw/wanderer-notifier-setup.sh | bash
```

Once the script finishes, update the `wanderer-notifier/.env` file with your configuration values, then proceed to [Step 4](#4-run-it).

### Manual Setup

If you'd rather set up everything manually, follow these steps:

#### 1. Download the Docker Image

Pull the latest Docker image:

```bash
docker pull guarzo/wanderer-notifier:latest
```

#### 2. Configure Your Environment

Create a `.env` file in your working directory with the following content. Replace the placeholder values with your actual credentials:

```dotenv
# Required Configuration
DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=your_discord_bot_token
DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=your_discord_channel_id
MAP_URL_WITH_NAME="https://wanderer.ltd/<yourmap>"
MAP_TOKEN=your_map_api_token

# Map Subscription Configuration (for enhanced features)
# Note: Premium features are enabled with your map subscription
LICENSE_KEY=your_map_license_key  # Provided with your map subscription

# Notification Control (all enabled by default)
# ENABLE_KILL_NOTIFICATIONS=true
# ENABLE_CHARACTER_TRACKING=true
# ENABLE_CHARACTER_NOTIFICATIONS=true
# ENABLE_SYSTEM_NOTIFICATIONS=true
# TRACK_ALL_SYSTEMS=false
```

> **Note:** If you don't have a Discord bot yet, follow our [guide on creating a Discord bot](https://gist.github.com/guarzo/a4d238b932b6a168ad1c5f0375c4a561) or search the web for more information.

#### 3. Create the Docker Compose Configuration

Create a file named `docker-compose.yml` with the following content:

```yaml
services:
  wanderer_notifier:
    image: guarzo/wanderer-notifier:latest
    container_name: wanderer_notifier
    restart: unless-stopped
    environment:
      - DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN=${DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN}
      - DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID=${DISCORD_CHANNEL_ID}
      - MAP_URL_WITH_NAME=${MAP_URL_WITH_NAME}
      - MAP_TOKEN=${MAP_TOKEN}
      - LICENSE_KEY=${LICENSE_KEY}
    ports:
      - 4000:4000
    volumes:
      - wanderer_data:/app/data
    healthcheck:
      test: ["CMD", "wget", "-q", "--spider", "http://localhost:${PORT:-4000}/health"]
      interval: 30s
      timeout: 3s
      retries: 3
      start_period: 10s
    logging:
      driver: "json-file"
      options:
        max-size: "10m"
        max-file: "3"

volumes:
  wanderer_data:
```

> **Note:** If you used the quick install option, these files have already been created for you.

#### 4. Run It

Start the service with Docker Compose:

```bash
docker-compose up -d
```

Your notifier is now up and running, delivering alerts to your Discord channel automatically!
